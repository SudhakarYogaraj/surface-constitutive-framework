Geometry-resolved direct numerical simulations (DNS) of 
lid driven cavity with a porous bed.
This example considers a two-layer porous medium structure

This folder contains two programs
1. 2DfluidNStokes_solver.edp -- Solves Navier-Stokes equations and obtain
                                field variables

2. 2DfluidNStokes_post.edp -- Reads output files generated from the first program
                              and generates 1D output files: dns_x0.txt & dns_y1.txt

The geometry of the solid inclusions, and the associated mesh are contained in
2DfluidNStokes_solver.brddef and 2DfluidNStokes_solver.brdmsh.
