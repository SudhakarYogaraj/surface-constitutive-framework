This folder contains microscale problems that are to be solved to determine
all the constitutive coefficients appearing in our model (section 5 of our paper)

The folders contain these programs

Lproblem -- used to compute coefficients L_{xx}, B, and M_{xz}
Kproblem -- used to compute K_{ij} and A_i
