This folder contains source codes to simulate lid driven cavity with a porous bed.
The geometry considered here is the two layer porous media problem explained in the paper. 
Both isotropic and anisotropic geometries can be simulated simply by changing the geometry.
Explanations of the folders are as follows:

DNS -- contains geometry resolved simulations.
microscale -- Codes to solve microscale problems to compute constitutive coefficients
    |
    |--> L problem -- computation of coefficients L, B, and M
    |
    |--> K problem -- computation of coefficients B and A
    |
effective -- Source code for effective simulation of porous cavity

Using these source codes all results in section 4.3 of the paper can be reproduced
