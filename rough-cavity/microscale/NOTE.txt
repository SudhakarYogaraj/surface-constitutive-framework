This folder contains the code to solve the microscale problem that is solved
to compute constitutive coefficients for effective description of rough wall flows (Lxx and Mzz).
The parameters used in the existing code will solve coefficients for interface
locaiton yi=0.2l as shown in figure 6(a). This will yield parameters used in 
the results described in figures 6(c) and 6(d).
In order to compute coefficients at yi=0.5l, as used in figure 7, the parameter
in the code 'intfShft' should be set to 0.5.

Execute the program by using the following command
          Freefem++ L-M-solver.edp

This produces the following outputs
2D_bound_cond_L_M_intf.txt -- contains coefficients Lxx and Mzz at the interface that are to be used in the effective program.
2D_bound_cond_L_distri.txt -- Distribution of line averaged solution field Lxx across interface normal direction.
