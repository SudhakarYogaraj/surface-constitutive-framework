This folder contains all source codes to simulate lid driven cavity with rough bottom.
Explanations of the folders are as follows:

DNS -- contains geometry resolved simulations.
microscale -- Codes to solve microscale problems to compute constitutive coefficients
effective -- Source code for effective simulation of rough cavity

Using these source codes all results in section 4.1 of the paper can be reproduced
